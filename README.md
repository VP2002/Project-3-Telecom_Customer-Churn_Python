# Telecom_Customer-Churn_PythonProject

 Telecom Customer Churn and Revenue Prediction using Python

 Task and Goal
The objective of this project is to develop an application for the marketing, product development, and sales teams of a telecommunications company. The application utilizes customer churn data to generate insights through graphs and figures. These insights can aid in the development of products, marketing strategies, and sales approaches targeted towards customers likely to stay with the company for a longer duration.

 What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers discontinue their services with a company. For a telecommunications company, churn signifies the rate at which subscribers terminate their services and switch to a competitor. Analyzing and monitoring customer churn is crucial for businesses, particularly in the telecommunications sector, as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones. By understanding customer churn, companies can identify weaknesses and strengths in their customer attrition strategy, leading to the development of tailored services and packages.

 Data Background
For this project, IBM's public sample dataset "Telecom Customer Churn" is utilized. The dataset, which simulates a typical dataset of a telecommunications company, contains 7043 observations and 22 variables. These variables encompass customer demographics, services subscribed to, account information, and churn status.

 Key Variables:
- Customer demographics: Gender, senior citizenship status, children, marital status.
- Services subscribed to: Phone line, multiple lines, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV and movies.
- Account information: Contract type, payment type, paperless billing, monthly and total charges.
- Churn: Indicates whether customers left within the past month.

 Dataset
The dataset is provided in CSV format and can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XkZWQsPRxyVE2qXcQKQOHu7MjYhs3RKW/view?usp=sharing).

 Objectives
1. Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or remain with the company.
2. Develop a model to predict the potential revenue generated from customers who remain with the company.

 Tools and Technologies
- Python: Programming language for data analysis and model building.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebook: Integrated development environment for interactive data analysis.

 Usage
1. Download the dataset from the provided link.
2. Utilize Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to perform data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
3. Interpret the results and generate insights to guide product development, marketing strategies, and sales approaches.

 Contribution
Contributions, suggestions, and improvements to the analysis and model development are welcome.
